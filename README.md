World Covid Data – April 2023

As part of my continuous learning journey, I completed my “World Covid Data – April 2023” project using Covid-19 Deaths data provided by OurWorldInData.org showing the reported mortality rates in the world as a result of Covid-19 from January 2020 – April 2023 (project end)
 
Through my analysis, I provided answers to a range of essential questions including:
 
-      What is the total world number of reported Covid-19 cases?
-      What is the total number of deaths and death percentage (mortality rate)?
-      Is there a correlation between Total deaths to income class?
-      What is the distribution of total reported deaths per Continent?
-      What is the distribution of total infection per country globally?
-      What is the distribution of Covid-related Deaths per country over the project time span?
 
While working with the data, I observed some limitations with the provided data including below:
-      No clear definition of how income classes were split.
- Migration, Deaths, Births, etc over project time was not considered with reference to the total population and hence impacting percentages used.
-      Potential issue with reported data in developing countries: I observed that developing countries in Africa, Asia, and South America, typically had lower reported numbers. Assuming the report is accurate, a correlation analysis of the country's GDP and Covid-19 number will be needed.
 
Within this project, tools used include MS Excel, SQL (Google BigQuery) and Tableau Public and some steps were taken below:
-      The data was downloaded as a CSV from the database.
-      MS Excel was used for preliminary data cleaning and analysis to understand the dataset.
-      File was uploaded to BigQuery (SQL).
-      Data completeness and data cleaning techniques were implemented.
-      Analysis was run to understand the dataset further and then the dataset for the required visualization was pulled.
-      All pulled data sets were uploaded to Tableau Public (it does not connect to databases) and visualization where done.
-      Finally, FORMAT! FORMAT!! FORMAT!!!
